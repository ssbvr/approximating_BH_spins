# Approximating Black-hole spins
Approximations to the spin of close Black-hole–Wolf-Rayet binaries based on the simulations presented in [Bavera et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...647A.153B/abstract).

Notice that the black-hole spin approximation presented in this work is model dependent on the core-collapse assumptions, which include [Fryer2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...749...91F/abstract) delayed core-collapse mechanism, fit to the (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae models of [Marchant2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882...36M/abstract), up to 0.5 Msun neutrino mass and AM loss as implemented in [Zevin2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...899L...1Z/abstract), and the arbitrary minimum BH mass of 2.5 Msun. All assumptions about these simulations are explained in detail in Appendixes C and D of [Bavera et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...647A.153B/abstract).
