# Approximating Black-hole spins
Approximations to the spin of close Black-hole–Wolf-Rayet binaries based on the simulations presented in [Bavera et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...647A.153B/abstract).

If using the approximation or any data of `BH-WR_dataset.csv.gz`, please cite the relevant work: Bavera et al. (2021) "Approximations to the spin of close Black-hole–Wolf-Rayet binaries".
